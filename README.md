# Data Structures and Algorithms

I created this repository to centralize my implementations of various popular data structures and algorithms as I learn them throughout my journey as a software engineer :computer:. 

**DISCLAIMER**: These implementations are meant to be readable and easily comprehensibly from a beginner's perspective, and therefore these most likely aren't the most efficient implementations possible (by a long shot).

## Future Plans
Although most/all of these implementations were initially written in JavaScript, my goal is to expand this repository to include implementations in other languages I plan to learn in the future, namely:
- Python
- Java
- C++
- Go
